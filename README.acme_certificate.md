# Role felixfontein.acme.acme_certificate

This is an [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) role which can use any CA supporting the ACME protocol, such as [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), [Buypass](https://www.buypass.com/ssl/products/acme) or [ZeroSSL](https://zerossl.com/features/acme/), to issue TLS/SSL certificates for your server.

The main advantage of this approach over others is that *almost no code is executed on your webserver*: only when you use HTTP challenges, files need to be copied onto your webserver, and afterwards deleted from it. Everything else is executed on your local machine! In particular, the account key is *never* sent to another machine.

This role does not cover installing the certificates, you have to do that yourself in another role.

## Parameters

See [here](./README.general-parameters.md) for general parameters, and for challenge-specific parameters.

These are the main variables used by the `felixfontein.acme.acme_certificate` role:

- `acme_certificate_domains`: The domain names you want to get a certificate for. Wildcards are only allowed as the first component, i.e. `*.example.com` is ok, while `*.*.example.com` and `www.*.example.com` are not ok. Also, when wildcards are used, not every challenge type is allowed. Let's Encrypt only allows wildcard domains with the `dns-01` challenge. At least one of `acme_certificate_domains` and `acme_certificate_ips` must be specified.
- `acme_certificate_ips`: The IP addresses you want to get a certificate for. Note that this is not supported by every CA! At least one of `acme_certificate_domains` and `acme_certificate_ips` must be specified.
- `acme_certificate_acme_email`: Your email address which shall be associated to the ACME account.
- `acme_certificate_algorithm`: The algorithm used for creating private keys. The default is `"rsa"`; other choices are `"p-256"`, `"p-384"` or `"p-521"` for the NIST elliptic curves `prime256v1`, `secp384r1` and `secp521r1`, respectively.
- `acme_certificate_key_length`: The bitlength to use for RSA private keys. The default is 4096.
- `acme_certificate_key_name`: The basename for storing the keys and certificates. The default is the first domain specified, with `*` replaced by `_`.
- `acme_certificate_keys_path`: Where the keys and certificates are stored. Default value is `"keys/"`.
- `acme_certificate_keys_old_path`: Where old keys and certificates should be copied to; used in case `acme_certificate_keys_old_store` is true. Default value is `"keys/old/"`.
- `acme_certificate_keys_old_store`: If set to `true`, will make copies of old keys and certificates. The copies will be stored in the directory specified by `acme_certificate_keys_old_store`. Default value is `false`.
- `acme_certificate_keys_old_prepend_timestamp`: Whether copies of old keys and certificates should be prepended by the current date and time. Default value is `false`.
- `acme_certificate_regenerate_private_keys`: Whether to regenerate private keys. Default value is `true`.
- `acme_certificate_use_sops_for_key`: Use [Mozilla sops](https://github.com/mozilla/sops) to encrypt private key. Needs `.sops.yaml` file inside the keys directory or somewhere up the directory chain. Default value is `false`.
- `acme_certificate_ocsp_must_staple`: Whether a certificate with the OCSP Must Staple extension is requested. Default value is `false`.
- `acme_certificate_terms_agreed`: Whether the terms of services are accepted or not. Default value is `false`, usually needs to be set explicitly to `true` to allow creating an ACME account. This is only used for ACME v2.
- `acme_certificate_challenge`: The challenge type to use. Should be `http-01` for HTTP challenges (needs access to web server) or `dns-01` for DNS challenges (needs access to DNS provider).
- `acme_certificate_root_certificate`: The root certificate for the ACME directory. Default value is `https://letsencrypt.org/certs/isrgrootx1.pem` for the root certificate of Let's Encrypt.
- `acme_certificate_deactivate_authzs`: Whether `authz`s (authorizations) should be deactivated afterwards. Default value is `true`. Set to `false` to be able to re-use `authz`s.
- `acme_certificate_modify_account`: Whether the ACME account should be created (if it doesn't exist) and the contact data (email address) should be updated. Default value is `true`. Set to `false` if you want to use the `community.crypto.acme_account` module to manage your ACME account (not done by this role).
- `acme_certificate_privatekey_mode`: Which file mode to use for the private key file. Default value is `"0600"`, which means read- and writeable by the owner, but not accessible by anyone else (except possibly `root`).
- `acme_certificate_select_chain`: Must be in the format described [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/crypto/acme_certificate_module.html#parameter-select_chain). Allows to select the certificate chain to be used; `acme_certificate_root_certificate` must be used in conjunction. This can be used for example with [Let's Encrypt](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/transition-to-isrgs-root-delayed-until-sep-29/125516) to select which root certificate to use. See below for concrete examples how to choose between the Let's Encrypt roots.

## Selecting which root to use with Let's Encrypt

The following configuration makes sure that the IdenTrust cross-signed intermediate is used, which is more compatible for example for older Android versions than the new IRSG root:
```.yaml
acme_certificate_root_certificate: https://letsencrypt.org/certs/trustid-x3-root.pem.txt
acme_certificate_select_chain:
  - test_certificates: last
    issuer:
      CN: DST Root CA X3
      O: Digital Signature Trust Co.
```
The following configuration selects the new IRSG X1 root:
```.yaml
acme_certificate_root_certificate: https://letsencrypt.org/certs/isrgrootx1.pem
acme_certificate_select_chain:
  - test_certificates: last
    issuer:
      CN: ISRG Root X1
      O: Internet Security Research Group
```

## Generated files

Let's assume you created TLS keys for `www.example.com`. You have to copy the relevant files to your webserver. The ansible role created the following files:

  * `keys/www.example.com.key`: this is the private key for the certificate. Ensure nobody can access it.
  * `keys/www.example.com.pem`: this is the certificate itself.
  * `keys/www.example.com-chain.pem`: this is the intermediate certificate(s) needed for a trust path.
  * `keys/www.example.com-fullchain.pem`: this is the certificate combined with the intermediate certificate(s).
  * `keys/www.example.com-rootchain.pem`: this is the intermediate certificate(s) combined with the root certificate. You might need this for OCSP stapling.
  * `keys/www.example.com-root.pem`: this is the root certificate of Let's Encrypt.

For configuring your webserver, you need the private key (`keys/www.example.com.key`), and either the certificate with intermediate certificate(s) combined in one file (`keys/www.example.com-fullchain.pem`), or the certificate and the intermediate certificate(s) as two separate files (`keys/www.example.com.pem` and `keys/www.example.com-chain.pem`). If you want to use [OCSP stapling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling), you will also need `keys/www.example.com-rootchain.pem`.

To get these files onto your web server, you could add tasks as follows:
```.yaml
- name: copy private keys
  copy:
    src: keys/{{ item }}
    dest: /etc/ssl/private/
    owner: root
    group: root
    mode: "0400"
  with_items:
  - www.example.com.key
  notify: reload webserver

- name: copy certificates
  copy:
    src: keys/{{ item }}
    dest: /etc/ssl/server-certs/
    owner: root
    group: root
    mode: "0444"
  with_items:
  - www.example.com-rootchain.pem
  - www.example.com-fullchain.pem
  - www.example.com.pem
  notify: reload webserver
```

The webserver configuration could look as follows (for nginx):
```
server {
    listen www.example.com:443 ssl;  # IPv4: listen to IP www.example.com points to
    listen [::]:443 ssl;             # IPv6: listen to localhost
    server_name www.example.com;
    
    # Allowing only TLS 1.0 and 1.2, with a very selective amount of ciphers.
    # According to SSL Lab's SSL server test, this will block:
    #   - Android 2.3.7
    #   - IE 6 and 8 under Windows XP
    #   - Java 6, 7 and 8
    # If that's not acceptable for you, choose other cipher lists. Look for
