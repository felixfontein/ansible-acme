    short_description: Issue TLS/SSL certificates from an ACME CA
    version_added: 0.1.0
    description:
      - "This is a role which can use any CA supporting the ACME protocol, such as L(Let's Encrypt,https://letsencrypt.org/),
        L(Buypass,https://www.buypass.com/ssl/products/acme) or L(ZeroSSL,https://zerossl.com/features/acme/), to issue
        TLS/SSL certificates for your server."
      - "The main advantage of this approach over others is that B(almost no code is executed on your webserver): only when
        you use HTTP challenges, files need to be copied onto your webserver, and afterwards deleted from it. Everything
        else is executed on your local machine! In particular, the account key is B(never) sent to another machine."
      - "This role does not cover installing the certificates, you have to do that yourself in another role."
