    short_description: Issue TLS/SSL certificates from an ACME CA
    version_added: 0.1.0
    description:
      - "This is a role which can use any CA supporting the ACME protocol, such as L(Let's Encrypt,https://letsencrypt.org/),
        L(Buypass,https://www.buypass.com/ssl/products/acme) or L(ZeroSSL,https://zerossl.com/features/acme/), to issue
        TLS/SSL certificates for your server."
      - "The main advantage of this approach over others is that B(almost no code is executed on your webserver): only when
        you use HTTP challenges, files need to be copied onto your webserver, and afterwards deleted from it. Everything
        else is executed on your local machine! In particular, the account key is B(never) sent to another machine."
      - "This role does not cover installing the certificates, you have to do that yourself in another role."

        description:
          - Allows to substitute parts of the DNS entry domain names. This can be very useful if
            certificates are obtained for domain names that are CNAMEs, and the DNS provider for where
            the CNAME points need to be modified.
          - The entries in this dictionary should be the names that are to be replaced, and the values
            the replacements. A single leading wildcard can be used to replace suffixes instead of the complete
            string, assuming the prefix has no further period (V(.)).
          - For example, if the key is V(*.example.com) and the value V(*.foo.example.org), the name V(_acme-challenge.example.com)
            will be replaced by V(*.foo.example.org). If the key is V(*.example.com) and the value V(foo.example.org),

            changed to V(foo.example.org).
          - Note that if you want to obtain certificates with ACME with O(acme_certificate_challenge=dns-01) for V(example.com)
            whose CNAME is V(foo.example.org), you should create (and provide in this variable) another CNAME record V(*.example.com),
