    short_description: Revoke old certificates
    version_added: 0.1.0
    description:
      - This is a role which can use any CA supporting the ACME protocol, such as L(Let's Encrypt,https://letsencrypt.org/),
        L(Buypass,https://www.buypass.com/ssl/products/acme) or L(ZeroSSL,https://zerossl.com/features/acme/), to revoke
        issued TLS/SSL certificates for your server.
      - This role assumes that the C(felixfontein.acme.acme_certificate) has been used with I(acme_certificate_keys_old_store)
        set to C(true). The role then copies the old certificate into C(keys/old/) (or the path configured by
        I(acme_certificate_keys_old_path)) before renewal. This role iterates over all certificates (respectively their private
        keys) in this directory and revokes them all with the given reason.
      - This role supports both plaintext private keys and sops-encrypted private keys (see I(acme_certificate_use_sops_for_key)
        option of the C(felixfontein.acme.acme_certificate) role.
      - Make sure that you first replace all usages of the old certificates by the new ones before revokation!

    options:
      acme_certificate_acme_account:
        type: str
        description:
          - Path to the private ACME account key. Either this or I(acme_certificate_acme_account_content) must always be specified.
      acme_certificate_acme_account_content:
        type: str
        description:
          - Content of the private ACME account key. Either this or I(acme_certificate_acme_account) must always be specified.
      acme_certificate_acme_account_uri:
        type: str
        description:
          - Instead of determining the account URI from the account key, assumes the given account URI.
      acme_certificate_acme_directory:
        type: str
        default: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
        description:
          - The ACME directory to use.
          - Default is C(https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory), which is the current production ACME v2 endpoint of Let's Encrypt.
      acme_certificate_acme_version:
        type: int
        default: 2
        description:
          - The ACME directory's version.
      acme_certificate_keys_old_path:
        type: str
        default: keys/old/
        description:
          - The directory where old keys and certificates were copied to by the C(felixfontein.acme.acme_certifiate) role.
      acme_certificate_revoke_with_acme_account:
        type: bool
        default: false
        description:
          - If set to C(true), will not use the private key of the certificate to revoke, but the account key.
          - This is needed for ACME providers which do not support revocation by private certificate key, like BuyPass.
      acme_certificate_revoke_reason:
        type: int
        default: 4
        description:
          - Which reason to use for revocation.
          - The default value is C(4) (B(superseeded), i.e. you issued a new certificate for the same set of domains, this is an old one).
          - Another sensible value is C(5) (B(cessation of operation), i.e. you don't want to use this set of domain names in
            a certificate anymore).
          - See the I(revoke_reason) parameter of the M(community.crypto.acme_certificate_revoke) module for a full list of reasons.
