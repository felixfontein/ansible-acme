      release_summary: Initial release of my `acme_certificate <https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/felixfontein/acme_certificate>`_
        role converted to a collection, with two new roles `revoke_old_certificates`
        and `account_key_rollover`.

  0.2.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - revoke_old_certificates role - allow to revoke by ACME account key instead
        of certificate private key by setting ``acme_certificate_revoke_with_acme_account``
        to ``true``. This allows to revoke certificates with BuyPass, which does not
        support revocation by certificate private key.
      release_summary: Feature and repository maintenance release.
    fragments:
    - 0.2.0.yml
    - revoke-by-acme-account.yml
    release_date: '2021-02-08'
  0.3.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - Replace ``felixfontein.hosttech_dns`` and ``felixfontein.tools`` collection
        dependencies by ``community.dns >= 1.0.0`` and ``community.general >= 2.5.0``.
      - acme_certificate role - remove usage of tags ``issue-tls-certs``, ``issue-tls-certs-newkey``
        and ``verify-tls-certs``. By default, new private keys are generated. This
        can be disabled by setting ``acme_certificate_regenerate_private_keys`` to
        ``false`` (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/15).
      bugfixes:
      - account_key_rollover role - when using sops-encrypted keys, ``community.sops.sops_encrypt``
        was run on the remote node and not the controller node (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/7).
      minor_changes:
      - Add documentation for the roles to the `collection's docsite <https://ansible.fontein.de/collections/felixfontein/acme/>`_
        (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/9).
      - Adding support for ansible-core's new role argument spec feature. This makes
        ansible-core 2.11.1 or newer validate the parameters passed to the roles in
        this collection (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/13).
      - Use ``community.dns.wait_for_txt`` to speed up waiting for DNS challenges
        to propagate.
      - acme_certificate - add ``acme_certificate_hosttech_token`` option to use HostTech's
        new JSON API instead of old WSDL API (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/12).
      - acme_certificate - check whether credentials for DNS provider are set before
        starting certificate retrieval (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/12).
      release_summary: Major revamp of the collection with new dependencies, better
        documentation, and several features and bugfixes.

  0.3.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - 'Hosttech DNS support: restrict required version of community.dns to < 2.0.0.
        A later version will bump the requirement to >= 2.0.0 and switch to the new
        API.'
      release_summary: Update dependencies.

    release_date: '2021-07-12'
  0.4.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - The collection now requires community.dns >= 2.0.0 for Hosttech DNS support.
      - The collection now requires community.general >= 4.0.0.
      - acme_certificate role - an alternative root certificate URL can be specified
        in ``acme_certificate_root_certificate_for_verification`` that is only used
        for validating the retrieved chain (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/22).
      - acme_certificate role - the role can now handle the DNS provider INWX (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/19).
      release_summary: This release bumps some requirements and adds some features.

    release_date: '2021-11-04'
  0.5.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - Officially drop support for Ansible 2.9.10 to 2.9.16, and ansible-base 2.10.0
        to 2.10.3. These versions did not work with the ``felixfontein.acme.acme_certificate``
        role for some time now, so this should not really affect any regular user
        of this collection (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/23).
      minor_changes:
      - In case an error happens before a certificate is issued, restore private key,
        and remove certificate and key backups if these were made (``acme_certificate_keys_old_store``
        option) (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/30).
      - The collection repository conforms to the `REUSE specification <https://reuse.software/spec/>`__
        (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/30).
      - Use FQCN for builtin actions and lookup plugins (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/23).
      - acme_certificate role - add ``acme_certificate_renewal_on_remaining_days``
        option which allows to only renew certificates that expire in a certain amount
        of days (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/28).
      release_summary: Feature release dropping support for some specific old Ansible/ansible-base
        versions.

    release_date: '2022-09-13'
  0.5.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - When cleaning up after failures in the ``acme_certificate`` role, make sure
        that an undefined ``ansible_failed_task`` does not cause another error (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/32).
      release_summary: Bugfix release.

  0.6.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - The collection no longer depends on community.aws >= 1.0.0, but on amazon.aws
        >= 5.0.0. The community.aws.route53 module was migrated to amazon.aws, which
        allows us to depend on one collection less. Note that if you use this collection
        with Ansible, you need Ansible 7.0.0 or newer; also note that Ansible 6.x.0
        and before are End of Life by now (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/39).
      bugfixes:
      - Avoid double failure of acme_certificate rescue task when first task in block
        fails (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/38).
      minor_changes:
      - acme_certificate role - add new option ``acme_certificate_dns_substitution``
        to allow substituting DNS names during DNS record creation for use with CNAMEs
        (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/41).
      - acme_certificate role - added new option ``acme_certificate_verify_auth``
        which allows to turn of validation that credentials for DNS modules are passed
        as role arguments. When disabled, you are responsible to pass credentials
        with module defaults or in other ways supported by the specific modules (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/issues/40,
        https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/42).

    release_date: '2023-01-02'
  0.7.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - Drop compatibility for Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10. These versions of
        Ansible/ansible-base have been End of Life for some time now. If you are still
        using them, either stick to an older version of this collection, or upgrade
        to a newer version of ansible-core/Ansible (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/54).
      minor_changes:
      - acme_certificate role - add Cloudflare DNS support (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/55).
      release_summary: New major release dropping compatibility with old Ansible versions,
        namely Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10.

  0.8.0:
    changes:
      major_changes:
      - The collection now depends on community.aws >= 6.3.0 and amazon.aws >= 6.3.0
        to improve stability of the acme_certificate role with Amazon's Route 53 DNS
        (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/62).
      minor_changes:
      - acme_certificate role - increase maximum wait for Hosttech DNS records from
        2 to 5 minutes (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/64).
      - acme_certificate role - use community.aws.route53_wait instead of community.dns.wait_for_txt
        when using Amazon's Route 53 DNS to improve stability (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/issues/57,
        https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/62).
      release_summary: Feature release with improved creation of DNS records for Route53
        and Hosttech.
