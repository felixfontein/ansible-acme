      release_summary: Initial release of my `acme_certificate <https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/felixfontein/acme_certificate>`_
        role converted to a collection, with two new roles `revoke_old_certificates`
        and `account_key_rollover`.

    release_date: '2020-12-16'
  0.2.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
        - revoke_old_certificates role - allow to revoke by ACME account key instead
          of certificate private key by setting ``acme_certificate_revoke_with_acme_account``
          to ``true``. This allows to revoke certificates with BuyPass, which does
          not support revocation by certificate private key.
      release_summary: Feature and repository maintenance release.
    fragments:
      - 0.2.0.yml
      - revoke-by-acme-account.yml
    release_date: '2021-02-08'
  0.3.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
        - Replace ``felixfontein.hosttech_dns`` and ``felixfontein.tools`` collection
          dependencies by ``community.dns >= 1.0.0`` and ``community.general >= 2.5.0``.
        - acme_certificate role - remove usage of tags ``issue-tls-certs``, ``issue-tls-certs-newkey``
          and ``verify-tls-certs``. By default, new private keys are generated. This
          can be disabled by setting ``acme_certificate_regenerate_private_keys``
          to ``false`` (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/15).
      bugfixes:
        - account_key_rollover role - when using sops-encrypted keys, ``community.sops.sops_encrypt``
          was run on the remote node and not the controller node (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/7).
      minor_changes:
        - Add documentation for the roles to the `collection's docsite <https://ansible.fontein.de/collections/felixfontein/acme/>`_
          (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/9).
        - Adding support for ansible-core's new role argument spec feature. This makes
          ansible-core 2.11.1 or newer validate the parameters passed to the roles
          in this collection (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/13).
        - Use ``community.dns.wait_for_txt`` to speed up waiting for DNS challenges
          to propagate.
        - acme_certificate - add ``acme_certificate_hosttech_token`` option to use
          HostTech's new JSON API instead of old WSDL API (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/12).
        - acme_certificate - check whether credentials for DNS provider are set before
          starting certificate retrieval (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/12).
      release_summary: Major revamp of the collection with new dependencies, better
        documentation, and several features and bugfixes.

  0.3.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - 'Hosttech DNS support: restrict required version of community.dns to < 2.0.0.
          A later version will bump the requirement to >= 2.0.0 and switch to the
          new API.'
      release_summary: Update dependencies.
    fragments:
      - 0.3.1.yml
      - hosttech.yml
    release_date: '2021-07-12'
  0.4.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
        - The collection now requires community.dns >= 2.0.0 for Hosttech DNS support.
        - The collection now requires community.general >= 4.0.0.
        - acme_certificate role - an alternative root certificate URL can be specified
          in ``acme_certificate_root_certificate_for_verification`` that is only used
          for validating the retrieved chain (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/22).
        - acme_certificate role - the role can now handle the DNS provider INWX (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/19).
      release_summary: This release bumps some requirements and adds some features.

    release_date: '2021-11-04'
  0.5.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
        - Officially drop support for Ansible 2.9.10 to 2.9.16, and ansible-base 2.10.0
          to 2.10.3. These versions did not work with the ``felixfontein.acme.acme_certificate``
          role for some time now, so this should not really affect any regular user
          of this collection (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/23).
      minor_changes:
        - In case an error happens before a certificate is issued, restore private
          key, and remove certificate and key backups if these were made (``acme_certificate_keys_old_store``
          option) (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/30).
        - The collection repository conforms to the `REUSE specification <https://reuse.software/spec/>`__
          (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/30).
        - Use FQCN for builtin actions and lookup plugins (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/23).
        - acme_certificate role - add ``acme_certificate_renewal_on_remaining_days``
          option which allows to only renew certificates that expire in a certain
          amount of days (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/28).
      release_summary: Feature release dropping support for some specific old Ansible/ansible-base
        versions.

      - 0.5.0.yml

    release_date: '2022-09-13'
  0.5.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - When cleaning up after failures in the ``acme_certificate`` role, make sure
          that an undefined ``ansible_failed_task`` does not cause another error (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/32).
      release_summary: Bugfix release.
    fragments:
      - 0.5.1.yml
      - 32-fail-task.yml

    fragments:
      - 0.5.2.yml
    release_date: '2022-09-18'
  0.6.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
        - The collection no longer depends on community.aws >= 1.0.0, but on amazon.aws
          >= 5.0.0. The community.aws.route53 module was migrated to amazon.aws, which
          allows us to depend on one collection less. Note that if you use this collection
          with Ansible, you need Ansible 7.0.0 or newer; also note that Ansible 6.x.0
          and before are End of Life by now (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/39).
      bugfixes:
        - Avoid double failure of acme_certificate rescue task when first task in
          block fails (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/38).
      minor_changes:
        - acme_certificate role - add new option ``acme_certificate_dns_substitution``
          to allow substituting DNS names during DNS record creation for use with
          CNAMEs (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/41).
        - acme_certificate role - added new option ``acme_certificate_verify_auth``
          which allows to turn of validation that credentials for DNS modules are
          passed as role arguments. When disabled, you are responsible to pass credentials
          with module defaults or in other ways supported by the specific modules
          (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/issues/40, https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/42).
      release_summary: Collection dependency update with bugfixes and new features.

          namespace: null
    release_date: '2023-01-02'
  0.7.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
        - Drop compatibility for Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10. These versions
          of Ansible/ansible-base have been End of Life for some time now. If you
          are still using them, either stick to an older version of this collection,
          or upgrade to a newer version of ansible-core/Ansible (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/54).
      minor_changes:
        - acme_certificate role - add Cloudflare DNS support (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/55).
      release_summary: New major release dropping compatibility with old Ansible versions,
        namely Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10.

      - 0.7.0.yml
      - 55-cloudflare.yml
    release_date: '2023-06-15'
  0.8.0:
    changes:
      major_changes:
        - The collection now depends on community.aws >= 6.3.0 and amazon.aws >= 6.3.0
          to improve stability of the acme_certificate role with Amazon's Route 53
          DNS (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/62).
      minor_changes:
        - acme_certificate role - increase maximum wait for Hosttech DNS records from
          2 to 5 minutes (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/64).
        - acme_certificate role - use community.aws.route53_wait instead of community.dns.wait_for_txt
          when using Amazon's Route 53 DNS to improve stability (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/issues/57,
          https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/62).
      release_summary: Feature release with improved creation of DNS records for Route53
        and Hosttech.
