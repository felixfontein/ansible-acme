minor_changes:
  - "The acme_certificate role now uses the new ``community.crypto.acme_account_order_*`` modules added in community.crypto 2.24.0 (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/86)."
  - "The collection now depends on community.crypto 2.24.0 or newer (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/86)."
  - "The acme_certificate role now supports ACME profile selection with the ``acme_certificate_profile`` parameter (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/86)."
  - "The acme_certificate role now supports determining whether to renew by remaining percentage of the validity period
     (``acme_certificate_renewal_on_remaining_percentage`` option) or ARI information (``acme_certificate_use_ari`` option)
     (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/86)."

breaking_changes:
  - "The collection no longer supports ``acme_certificate_acme_version == 1``. ACME v2 must always be used (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/86)."

security_fixes:
  - "Properly apply ``no_log: true`` to task that reads private key file for backup. When not using SOPS encrypted private keys,
     the private key was visible in verbose mode or in the logs in plain text (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/86)."
