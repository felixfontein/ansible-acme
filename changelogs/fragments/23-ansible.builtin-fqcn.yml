minor_changes:
  - "Use FQCN for builtin actions and lookup plugins (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/23)."
breaking_changes:
  - "Officially drop support for Ansible 2.9.10 to 2.9.16, and ansible-base 2.10.0 to 2.10.3. These versions did not work with the ``felixfontein.acme.acme_certificate`` role for some time now, so this should not really affect any regular user of this collection (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/23)."
