minor_changes:
  - "acme_certificate role - added new option ``acme_certificate_verify_auth`` which allows to turn of validation that credentials for DNS modules are
     passed as role arguments. When disabled, you are responsible to pass credentials with module defaults or in other ways supported by the specific
     modules (https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/issues/40, https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-acme/pull/42)."
